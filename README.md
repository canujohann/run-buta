I’ve tried to develop a very basic game based on the AndEgine framework. Score are managed through the Swarm library.


How to instal it :

Clone this repository
Clone AndEgine and import it as library
Create a Swarm account
Download Swarm and import it as library

I’ve first developed this game for my Japanese colleagues, so all comments are in Japanese… I will  try to translate it  before the end of march ! Thank you for your patience !
