Run Kobuta !
==========

### Intro

I’ve tried to develop a very basic game based on the AndEgine framework. Scores are managed through the Swarm library.

### How to instal it :

1. Clone this repository 
2. Clone AndEgine and import it as library 
3. Create a Swarm account 
4. Download Swarm and import it as library
5. Set your Swarm info (/src/com/canujohann/utils/Consts.java)

I've first developed this game for my Japanese colleagues, so all comments are in Japanese… I will try to translate it before the end of march ! Thank you for your patience !
